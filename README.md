This hands-on project focuses on developing an AI-enabled application using Python and Flask. As part of the course, I completed tasks such as:  
- Developing functions and application logic  
- Exchanging data using Watson AI libraries  
- Sorting and organising data using code  
- Writing unit tests  
- Packaging the application for distribution  

This project showcases my ability to build and integrate AI-powered features into web applications.
